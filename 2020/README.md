# Advent of Code, 2020

If you're reading this them you're probably familiar with the
"[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020)" challenge. If
not, it's:

> ...an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill
> sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

I've done it (partially) in other years. This year I'm trying to learn
my Kotlin. I'm not building a full test harness and all that stuff, I'm
playing in VS Code and the Kotlin REPL.
