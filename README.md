# Advent of Code

If you're reading this them you're probably familiar with the
"[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)" challenge. If
not, it's:

> ...an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill
> sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

These are (some of) my attempts. Mostly unfinished. Sorry.
