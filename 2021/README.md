# Advent of Code, 2021

If you're reading this them you're probably familiar with the
"[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021)" challenge. If
not, it's:

> ...an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill
> sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

I've done it (partially) in other years. This year I'm trying to improve
Python.
